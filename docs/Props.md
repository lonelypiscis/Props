## What is Props?

Props is a Sponge plugin for creating custom blocks and items.

## How does it work?

Since Minecraft version 1.9 the game allows resource packs to change an item's appearance depending on their damage value. Not only can their texture be changed, but also their model.

Props compiles predefined model files, creating a resource pack which is sent to the players. The plugin also handles block placement by spawning correctly positioned ArmorStands which hold the new blocks or items in their hand. New items are created by modifying an ItemStack's NBT-Data accordingly.
